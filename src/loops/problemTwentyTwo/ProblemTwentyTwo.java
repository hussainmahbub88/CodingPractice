	 * Read in three values representing respectively
		a capital sum (integer number of taka),
		a rate of interest in percent (float),
		and a number of years (integer).
		Compute the values of the capital sum with compound interest added over the given period of years. Each year's interest is calculated as
		interest = capital * interest_rate / 100;
		and is added to the capital sum by
		capital = capital + interest;
		Print out money values as pounds (pence / 100.0) accurate to two decimal places. Print out a floating value for the value with compound interest for each year up to the end of the period.
		Print output year by year in a form such as:
		Original sum 30000.00 at 12.5 percent for 20 years
		Year Interest  Sum
